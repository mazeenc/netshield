        <h3 class="question">1. How can I ensure that my personal information remains secure when using online
          educational platforms or submitting assignments electronically?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>To keep your personal information secure on online educational platforms, use strong, unique passwords for each account and avoid sharing sensitive details unnecessarily.

          while engaging in virtual classrooms or socializing online with classmates?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Protect yourself from cyberbullying and online harassment by being mindful of what you share online and who you interact with.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>When downloading educational resources or software from the internet, only use reputable sources and verify the legitimacy of the download before proceeding.

        <h3 class="question">4. How can I recognize and avoid online scams targeting students, such as fake scholarship offers or
          fraudulent job postings?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Be skeptical of unsolicited offers, especially those promising scholarships or job opportunities that seem too good to be true. Research the organization or company offering the opportunity, and never provide personal or financial information without verifying the legitimacy of the offer first. If in doubt, consult with school counselors or trusted advisors for guidance.</p>

        <h3 class="question">5. What measures should I implement to safeguard my online accounts and passwords, especially when accessing
          school-related platforms or services from multiple devices?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Safeguard your online accounts and passwords by using strong, complex passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information such as your name or birthdate. Consider using a password manager to securely store and manage your passwords across multiple devices. Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible for an extra layer of security. Regularly update your passwords and monitor your accounts for any suspicious activity.</p>
